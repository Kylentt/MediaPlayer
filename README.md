> - If you want to clone this simply remove the BuildConfig check in `MPApplication`
> - ~~Audio should be inside the `Music` or Folder Generated by the OS~~ Android 29 / Q only
> - Audio Images are fetched from the Album Art and not the one embedded in the files. `Might support this in the future with ID3v2`
