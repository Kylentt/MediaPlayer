# MediaPlayer

Simple MediaPlayer App that able to Scan &amp; Play local playable Media. Using Exoplayer with Dagger-hilt &amp; ViewModels

Kind of ready, pretty much usable

> - If you want to clone this simply remove the BuildConfig check in `MPApplication`
> - ~~Audio should be inside the `Music` or Folder Generated by the OS~~ Android 29 / Q only
> - Audio Images are fetched from the Album Art and not the one embedded in the files. `Might support this in the future with ID3v2`
> - Android Nougat 7.0 / API 24 and above

Features :
- Foreground Service on Background & Lock (tested 29 & 30 only)
- Playlist From Album & Artist row in `Home`
- MediaStore Audio Files Scan
- Playing Fragment with Palette Api & Glide transformations
- Folder Path
- Viewpager display currently playing song along with Album Images

Working On:
- Artist & Album Fragment
- Better Transport Control
- Better UI / UX


Plans :
- History, Favorite, Playlist, Album Image Changer with Room & DataStore. `> ID3v2 If Possible`
- Video Player support with                                               `> PiP, Brightness by Scroll, Volume by Scroll, Seekbar Preview`
- Media Streaming with Firebase.                                          `> Got Firebase Storage Limit so might be just Downloadable Instead`
- Google & Others Login handled by Firebase.                              `> Might add Local Account but most likely not `
- Custom Theming
